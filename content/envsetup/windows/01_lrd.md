title: Create a Local Root Directory
label: envsetup-windows-lrd
---

You will create a directory that you will use as your **local root directory** (LRD) for this course. This directory can be anywhere on your computer. We will refer to your **local root directory** through the remainder of the semester.

:::{important}
File management is going to be **extremely** important in this course! Please be aware of the specific file and directory paths that are used!
:::

## Create the Directory

1. **Create a directory** with the name `mgmt47800` somewhere on your computer that makes sense to you (e.g., `Documents` or `OneDrive`)
2. You will create subdirectories within your LRD for each project in the course
3. Your directory structure should be set up similar to the following:

```
Documents/
├── mgmt47800/
│   ├── getting_started
│       └── getting_started.ipynb
│   ├── project01/
│       └── project01.ipynb
```
