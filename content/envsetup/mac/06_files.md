**Almost finished!** Let's install Visual Studio Code – the recommended integrated development environment (IDE) for this course – and download some files we'll use to test the environment.

## Install VS Code

1. **(If not already done) Install Visual Studio Code**
   * Download **VS Code for macOS** from the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * Open the downloaded `.zip` file to extract the application
   * Drag **Visual Studio Code** from your Downloads folder to your **Applications** folder
   * Launch VS Code from your Applications folder or Spotlight

2. **Install the Python Extension in VS Code**
   * Open VS Code
   * Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (or press {kbd}`Cmd` + {kbd}`Shift` + {kbd}`X`)
   * Search for and install the **Python** extension provided by Microsoft

## Create a Project Directory on Your Computer

3. **Create the Project Directory**
   * Open **Finder** by clicking the Finder icon in your Dock
   * Press {kbd}`Cmd` + {kbd}`Shift` + {kbd}`H` to navigate to your home directory
   * Navigate to your local root directory named `mgmt47800` (likely in `Documents` or wherever you created it)
   * Right-click in the empty space, select **New Folder**, and name it `getting_started`

## Download the Getting Started Files
4. **Download and Move the Getting Started Notebook and Associated Files**
   * Download the [`getting_started.zip`](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/ree_purdue_edu/Documents/Course%20Documentation/MGMT%2047800%20-%20Experiential%20Projects%20in%20Analytics/student_files/getting_started/verification_test.ipynb.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=KgwMDH) file linked here
   * Extract the files by double-clicking the `.zip` file
   * Locate the extracted folder in your **Downloads** folder
      * You should see the following three files:
         * `getting_started.ipynb`
         * `pyproject.toml`
         * `README.md`
   * **MOVE ALL THREE FILES INTO YOUR** `mgmt47800/getting_started` folder

   Your directory structure should now look like this:
   ```
   Documents/
   ├── mgmt47800/
   │   ├── getting_started/
   │       └── getting_started.ipynb
   │       └── pyproject.toml
   │       └── README.md
   ```
