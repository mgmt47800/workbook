title: 01 - Environment Setup
---

You'll need to set up a robust, portable working environment for the analytics projects you undertake in this course. Everyone's personal computer setup is different. Follow these steps as closely as possible to get the best start you can in this course.

:::{note}
If you work on multiple computers (such as a laptop and a desktop), you should repeat these instructions for each machine.

This course will teach you the proper file creation, structure, and management skills to ensure your work can be picked up no matter where you are.

## Required Services
Everyone will be using a common set of tools and services in this course. Prior to following these instructions, you'll need to ensure you have access.

### GitHub
You'll use [GitHub](https://github.com) to back up your individual files as well as collaborate with your teammates in later projects.
- *(If you already have a GitHub account, there's no need to create a new one!)*
- Otherwise, create a FREE GitHub account

:::{tip} 
GitHub is a great place to "show off" projects that you've done to potential employers. Keep your GitHub clean, professional, and up-to-date and use it as an asset in your job search!
:::

### Visual Studio Code
We will make extensive use of [Visual Studio Code]() as the integrated development environment (IDE) in this course. Ensure you download and install the correct version for your computer.

:::{note} 
Advanced students may wish to use a different IDE or setup. That's fine, with these caveats:
- All classroom demonstrations will use the tools and services listed here
- Technical support is not available for tools and services not listed here
- You **WILL** be collaborating with other students later in the semester. This will be easiest if everyone uses the same tools

## Instructions Based on Your OS
With GitHub set up and VS Code installed, you're ready to set up your environment. Choose the Operating System for your computer:

- [Windows](/content/envsetup/windows/01_intro.md)
- [Mac](/content/envsetup/mac/01_intro.md)
