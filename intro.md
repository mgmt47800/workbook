# Welcome to MGMT 47800!

The purpose of this notebook is to provide easy reference to technical instructions that you'll need to undertake in this course.

This workbook is a "work in progress" and will continue to evolve as the semester progresses and as the technical environment changes. Feel free to inform the instructor about corrections needed and/or make suggestions for improvement.

## Course Requirements

### Local Development
You may have experience with Colab (also known as Google Colab or Collaboratory), which is a very useful tool in data science. However, the free version of Colab has a few quirks that would make your work in this course more challenging. Additionally, there is a great deal of value in knowing how to properly set up a development environment and manipulate your operating system.

Therefore, we will work to establish a reliable working environment on your local computer.

### Laptop Access
You must provide your own computer for this course. It's best if you can bring that computer with you to every class session, charged and ready to go. **A tablet or Chromebook WILL NOT work in this course.**

If this is an issue for you, please feel free to discuss the situation with the instructor privately and we will work out an alternative solution.
